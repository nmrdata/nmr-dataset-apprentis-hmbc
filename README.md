This series of exercises is provided by Noah Mayor and Julia Villiger, trainee chemistry laboratory assistants, at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL).

It includes the full dataset (proton, carbon (coupled and decoupled), COSY, HSQC, and HMBC) of common solvents.

It is divided into 5 series in order to show students the different NMR experiments:

- Proton spectrum
- Coupled and decoupled carbon spectra
- COSY spectrum
- HSQC/HMBC spectra
- Full dataset

You can either provide the link to all the series or to a specific series.
